In a scary night when the dark devoured everything\n
The words ran away and the silence starts to sing\n
Under its tones, the spirits were dancing in a magical way
And my cigarette smoke was flying so far away
To tell the stars, the moon and the dark sky..
About all the truths that has drowned in a river of a great lie.
But the silence' s song turned into a frightening loudness
The dead spirits stoped to dance, getting back to their continuous sadness
Meanwhile the smoke was flying, crossing all the limits
Taking all the untold stories to a place where everything is real.

I wish I could dig a deep hole in your soul to fill it up with all the spring's roses and the magical moonlight to remind you that the spring was made for you and the moon appears every night to watch you...-jasser`    },{

            scribbled, full of unordered papers wetted by tears
            written by the mature man who's crying in its corner
            like a beaten soldier after losing his blessed armor.
            a lot of drawings and pictures were hanging on its wall
            of a little boy, all that he cared about was his dog and pink ball
            Now he's lying on his bed watching what he has become
            an empty person hopelessly waiting for happiness to come
            the window of that room overlooks the whole beautiful sky
            in the daytime, the little boy looks up to blue dreaming to fly
            but when night falls, the man uses to watch the darkness
            filling up his chest with sorrow and a continuous sadness

            Watered by the winter's rain,
            you were blooming all day.
            Although you missed your precious spring,
            and a thousand birds when they sing,
            you offered December a unique smell
            mixed with thoughts in your mind's cell
            and the sorrow of your heart's hell.
            touched by the winter's sun
            you saw a baby having fun
            heard him loudly saying
            "mom! flowers do only bloom in spring?"
            she said " yes, you're right son"
            you didn't like what you heard
            and you wished she didn' say a word
            because you don't belong to the familiar type
            and you never believe what they think is right
            light is your darkness and darkness is your light

            one cut, two cuts, three cuts, and the blood was everywhere
            in her eyes, life was very tough and unfair
            passing her last painful days in her little room
            waiting the long hours for the day of her doom
            
            the terrible voices in her head were scaring her
            a weak person, that's what they want her to be

            and won't give up on her till she loses her breath
            
            they made her wondering that dying is the salvation
            from all her grief, and her continuous frustration
